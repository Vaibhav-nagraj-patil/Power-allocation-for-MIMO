# Power-allocation-for-MIMO
  Iâ€™ve developed a MIMO capacity simulation in MATLAB and Python that compares optimal and equal power allocation schemes across different SNR levels. The code highlights the impact of power allocation on system capacity, demonstrating the advantages of optimizing power distribution in MIMO systems.
